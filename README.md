# Chat_PDF

This repository is an attempt to build a Chat-with-your-docs app.

To try this app, check: 

It is inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXxQ0LR-3Hg&t=3409s. 

I made some changes in the component of the chain model to experiment with the Langchain framework.

At the same time, I added some new features for retrieving the source of the answer given by AI and visualizing the PDFs in one column to quickly check the source of the answer.

The display of PDFs is still in progress. At the moment, it only displays text form and ignores the rest. If you have any suggestions to fully embed PDFs in Streamlit Apps, I'm more than glad to discuss them.
